# 3D-Ilp-Generator
### Basic info:
This project is extended version of two dimensional Python ILP file generator to handle the three dimensional case.
The original 2D ILP generator was written in Perl by Daniel Gusfield from University of California, Davis.
Therefore, I translated this into the Python code and modified so that it can handle the 3D case.
